    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am Maureen Kimondo, a final-year Criminology and Criminal Justice student at the University of Nairobi. While my academic path focuses on understanding human behavior, justice and societal systems, I am equally passionate about technology and the limitless opportunities it offers. I believe in blending social awareness with digital innovation to create meaningful impact. I am currently diving into software development and excited to build a career that bridges justice, tech and human-centered solutions. Curious, driven, and a little bit of a perfectionistâ€”I am here to learn, build and leave a mark.  </p>
